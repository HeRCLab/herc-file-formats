# TNX

*Trivial Neural network eXchange*

**WiP**: this repo does not contain any working code yet. The proposed format can be found in [`./doc`](./doc).

This repository contains code to interface with data in the TNX format, created to support several of [HeRC Lab](https://cse.sc.edu/~jbakos/group/)'s ongoing projects. It also includes a tool to convert TNX to and from [ONNX](http://onnx.ai/) format. Note that only a limited subset of ONNX is supported.
